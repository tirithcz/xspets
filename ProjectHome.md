XS Pets is the source code behind the XS Quail breed-able pets on Second Life.

Because of people that fail to read licenses - almost everyone it seems - let me boil it down.

You are REQUIRED to include in your documentation (or source code if you are giving that away) the copyright notice and a copy of the original license.

That would look something like this:

Based on XS-Pets Scripts (c) 2010 Xundra Snowpaw.

It is not fair the number of people that have made hundreds of dollars off my work and failed to acknowledge their sources.
